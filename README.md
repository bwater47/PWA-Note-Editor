- An innovative PWA Note Editor that provides an installable, offline-capable solution for taking and managing notes with a user-friendly interface and reliable data caching.

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to create a simple and reliable tool for taking notes that can be accessed offline. I wanted to enhance productivity by providing a convenient way for users to capture their thoughts and ideas anytime, anywhere, without worrying about internet connectivity.
- This project was built to offer a user-friendly and installable progressive web application for note-taking. It aims to provide a seamless experience for users to create, edit, and organize their notes while ensuring that their data is cached and accessible offline.
- This solves the problem of unreliable access to notes due to internet connectivity issues. By caching the data locally, the PWA Note Editor ensures that users can always access their notes, even when they are offline. It also addresses the need for a straightforward and efficient note-taking application that can be easily installed and used on any device.
- In this project, I learned how to implement a progressive web application that supports offline functionality through caching. I gained experience in using modern web development tools like Webpack and Babel, and I deepened my understanding of service workers and the IndexedDB API for local storage. Additionally, I improved my skills in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces for web applications.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM Express, NPM if-env, NPM concurrently, NPM nodemon, NPM @babel/core, NPM @babel/plugin-transform-runtime, NPM @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread, NPM @babel/preset-env, NPM @babel/runtime, NPM babel-loader, NPM css-loader, NPM html-webpack-plugin, NPM http-server, NPM style-loader, NPM webpack, NPM webpack-cli, NPM webpack-dev-server, NPM webpack-pwa-manifest, NPM workbox-webpack-plugin, NPM code-mirror-themes, NPM idb, and NPM Mongoose. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode (IDE). Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, npm build to bundle your code using webpack, and then npm start:dev to start of the server and change directories to be in the correct folder. Once you've done this the server will be deployed for local testing, debugging, and developing.

## Usage
